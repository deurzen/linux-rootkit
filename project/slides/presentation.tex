  \framesubtitle{Dynamic Kernel Memory}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Dynamic kernel memory is..
    \begin{itemize}
\pause
    \item ..hard to make sense of -- usually, no type information is available
\pause
    \item ..changing \textit{very} frequently
\pause
    \item ..difficult to analyze!
    \end{itemize}
\pause
    \item How can we make analysis easier?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\insertsection}
  \framesubtitle{LiveDM}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item LiveDM seeks to overcome the previous issues
\pause
    \item Memory allocations and frees (example: \texttt{kmalloc} and \texttt{kfree}) can be intercepted
\pause
    \item Going from there, LiveDM is able to create a memory map
\pause
    \item This map even includes type information!
  \end{itemize}
